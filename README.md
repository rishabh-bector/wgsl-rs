# wgsl-rs

A linker for WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) shaders. This crate aims to provide Rust-like module support for WGSL shaders. In other words, no more thousand-line shader files full of duplicated code. The official [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) implementation for Rust can be found [here](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu).
